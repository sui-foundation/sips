## Abstract

Currently, both Sui Wallet and Sui Keystore support import and export for private keys in 32-byte Hex encoding. This SIP proposes to change the import and export interface only accept 33-bytes `flag || private_key` Bech32 encoded string with human readable part (HRP) as `suiprivkey` for both Sui Wallet and Sui Keystore.

## Motivation

This SIP is proposed to visually distinguish a 32-byte private key representation from a 32-bytes Sui address that is currently also Hex encoded. This prevents human errors from accidentally importing a Sui address as a private key to a wallet, or entering a private key as a Sui address when creating a transaction.

This also always includes the 1-byte flag before the 32-byte private key to keep the Sui wallet and the Sui Keystore representation consistent. No appending flag byte is required when importing and exporting from Sui Wallet to Sui Keystore or vice versa.

## Specification

To import a private key to Sui Keystore or Sui Wallet, a Bech32 encoded 33-byte `flag || private_key` must be supplied. 

To export a private key from Sui Keystore or Sui Wallet, a Bech32 encoded 33-byte `flag || private_key` is output.

See [BIP-173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) for Bech32 encoding specifications. The human readable part (HRP) for Sui private key is defined as `suiprivkey`.

### What Changed

Sui Keytool CLI

1. `sui keytool convert`: Add a new keytool command to convert a legacy format to the new Bech32 format. 
2. `sui keytool export`: Add a new keytool command to export a Bech32 format private key from Sui Keystore.  
3. `sui keytool import`: Modify the behavior of the existing import private key command to disallow Hex encoded 32-byte private key and only allow the new Bech32 format. 

Sui Wallet and SDK

The SDK offers the following new interfaces. 

```typescript
import { bech32 } from 'bech32';

/**
 * This returns an ParsedKeypair object based by validating the
 * 33-byte Bech32 encoded string starting with `suiprivkey`, and
 * parse out the signature scheme and the private key in bytes.
 */
export function decodeSuiPrivateKey(value: string): ParsedKeypair {
	const { prefix, words } = bech32.decode(value);
	if (prefix !== SUI_PRIVATE_KEY_PREFIX) {
		throw new Error('invalid private key prefix');
	}
	const extendedSecretKey = new Uint8Array(bech32.fromWords(words));
	const secretKey = extendedSecretKey.slice(1);
	const signatureScheme =
		SIGNATURE_FLAG_TO_SCHEME[extendedSecretKey[0] as keyof typeof SIGNATURE_FLAG_TO_SCHEME];
	return {
		schema: signatureScheme,
		secretKey: secretKey,
	};
}

/**
 * This returns a Bech32 encoded string starting with `suiprivkey`,
 * encoding 33-byte `flag || bytes` for the given the 32-byte private
 * key and its signature scheme.
 */
export function encodeSuiPrivateKey(bytes: Uint8Array, scheme: SignatureScheme): string {
	if (bytes.length !== PRIVATE_KEY_SIZE) {
		throw new Error('Invalid bytes length');
	}
	const flag = SIGNATURE_SCHEME_TO_FLAG[scheme];
	const privKeyBytes = new Uint8Array(bytes.length + 1);
	privKeyBytes.set([flag]);
	privKeyBytes.set(bytes, 1);
	return bech32.encode(SUI_PRIVATE_KEY_PREFIX, bech32.toWords(privKeyBytes));
}
```

Sui Wallet UI uses these interfaces when importing private key and exporting private key. 

## Rationale

The proposed encoding change from Hex to Bech32 for private keys is to clearly distinguish a Sui address (32-byte Hex) from a Sui private key.

Why Bech32? It is the most modern encoding standardized by Bitcoin. It supports checksum and eliminates error-prone characters. In addition, It contains a human readable part (HRP) indicating it is a private key very noticeably (i.e. "suiprivkey"). 

See [BIP-173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) for more, note that Bitcoin uses Bech32 for address encoding, whereas this SIP proposes Bech32 encoding for Sui private key standard. 

With the new encoding, a private key will not be validated by Sui Wallet as a Sui address, given its length and its different encoding in wallet. It should not be confused as a Sui address (32-byte Hex encoded) or transaction digest (32-byte Base58 encoding).

## Backwards Compatibility

This change is currently backward compatible for importing private key. Users can still import Hex encoded private keys as well as Bech32 encoded private keys. Sui Wallet currently only supports export Bech32 encoded private keys.

Starting March 1, 2024, newer versions of Sui Wallet will stop supporting Hex encoding private key import and only allow Bech32 encoding to be imported. We advise all wallets in Sui ecosystem to adopt similar migration plan to deprecate Hex encoding export immediately, and deprecate Hex encoding import gradually.

## Utilities

To convert a private key from Hex to Bech32 with CLI:

```bash
sui keytool convert 0x1b87a727f58830d9ba2bfe6ecdc8fb49aa96fa2a2bbe175e128bfee13f6895ff
```

To export a private key with CLI: 

```bash
sui keytool export
```

## Security Considerations

This SIP reduces risks for a user mixing usage of a private key and a Sui address, hence increases the security of Sui Wallet and Sui Keystore.
